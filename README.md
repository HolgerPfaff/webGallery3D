# webGallery3D
A 3D-walkthrough-Gallery for painted images in 3D using Three.js
---
This is my first try to create a 3D-web-gallery. It is far from finished, the code is still experimental, but it seems to work.
---
All images were painted in Acrylic by Holger Pfaff
All 3d-models were also created by Holger Pfaff and some of the javscript-code, except those magic libs like Three.js
All other textures are from http://cgtextures.com/
The space-skybox was created by 'amethyst7' aka Chris Matz
The AssimJSONLoader.js was written by Alexander Gessler (http://www.greentoken.de)
The PointerLockControls.js was written by mrdoob (http://mrdoob.com)

I used a lot of other javascript-snippets I found around the net, for example at
http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/

Thanks to all people at the Three.js team and to all people around who help to provide examples.

I promise to clean up the mess when it runs the way I want it to run.
