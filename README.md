# webGallery3D
A 3D-walkthrough-Gallery for painted images in 3D using Three.js #
---
This is my first try to create a 3D-web-gallery. It is far from finished, the code is still experimental, but it seems to work.

The images were painted in acrylic by Holger Pfaff. All 3d-models were created by Holger Pfaff and some of the javscript-code, except those magic libs like *Three.js* or *Require.js*. 
All other textures are from http://cgtextures.com/. The space-skybox was created by 'amethyst7' aka Chris Matz. The AssimJSONLoader.js was written by Alexander Gessler (http://www.greentoken.de). 
The code in *PointerLockControls.js* was written by mrdoob (http://mrdoob.com). I used a lot of other javascript-snippets I found around the net, for example at
http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/

Thanks to all people at the Three.js team and to all people around who help to provide examples. I promise to clean up the mess when it runs the way I want it to run.
